                <p>
                    Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as
                    the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram,
                    Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a
                    scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation
                    (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
                    space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile
                    Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He
                    also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear
                    tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
                </p>
                <p>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
                    Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
                    "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service
                    after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna,
                    India's highest civilian honour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died
                    from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level
                    dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried
                    with full state honours.

            <h2>Early life and Education</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>
                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the
                    pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State
                    of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his
                    mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth
                    between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.
                </p>
                <p>Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy
                    Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a
                    Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders
                    and local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the
                    island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With
                    the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the
                    family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was
                    poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the
                    family's meager income.
                </p>
                <p>In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student
                    who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics. After
                    completing his education at Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to
                    attend the St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli from where he graduated in Physics in 1954.
                </p>
                <p>Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. While
                    Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and
                    threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days.
                    Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress
                    and asking you to meet a difficult deadline." He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a
                    fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.

            <h2>Career as a Scientist</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>
                <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam began his career
                    at the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation
                    (DRDO) as a scientist. Initially working on a small hovercraft, he soon joined INCOSPAR under the
                    guidance of Vikram Sarabhai and was recruited into ISRO by H.G.S. Murthy. In 1969, Kalam was
                    transferred to ISRO, where he became the project director of India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle
                    (SLV-III), successfully deploying the Rohini satellite in 1980. He also visited several NASA
                    facilities in the early 1960s.
                </p>
                <p>Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam contributed significantly to the development of the Polar
                    Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects. He was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness
                    India’s first nuclear test, Smiling Buddha, in 1974. During the 1970s, Kalam led two crucial
                    projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, aimed at developing ballistic missiles. Despite initial
                    resistance, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi provided secret funding for these projects.
                </p>
                <p>Kalam's work earned him great respect and led to the launch of the Integrated Guided Missile
                    Development Programme (IGMDP) in the 1980s, with a budget of ₹3.88 billion. Under this programme,
                    Kalam played a pivotal role in developing several missiles, including Agni and Prithvi, although
                    these projects faced criticism for mismanagement and delays.
                </p>
                <p>From July 1992 to December 1999, Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister
                    and Secretary of DRDO. He played a key role in the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, working closely
                    with Rajagopala Chidambaram. Despite some controversy regarding the test results, Kalam emerged as a
                    prominent figure in India's nuclear science community.
                </p>
                <p>In 1998, Kalam collaborated with cardiologist Soma Raju to develop the low-cost "Kalam-Raju Stent."
                    In 2012, they introduced the "Kalam-Raju Tablet," a rugged tablet computer designed for healthcare
                    in rural areas.

            <h2>Presidency</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>
                <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam served as the 11th President of India from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007,
                    succeeding K. R. Narayanan. Nominated by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and supported by the
                    Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party, Kalam won the 2002 presidential election with
                    922,884 electoral votes against Lakshmi Sahgal's 107,366 votes. His victory was widely anticipated,
                    and he was sworn in on 25 July 2002.
                </p>
                <p>Kalam was the first scientist and bachelor to become President of India, and the third to receive the
                    Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor, before becoming President. During his tenure, he was
                    affectionately known as the People's President. One of his most challenging decisions was signing
                    the Office of Profit Bill. He faced criticism for his handling of mercy petitions, acting on only
                    one out of twenty-one, notably rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was
                    subsequently hanged. Another high-profile case was that of Afzal Guru, involved in the 2001 Indian
                    Parliament attack, whose execution was delayed due to a pending mercy plea.
                </p>
                <p>Kalam also made a controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005. In 2003, he
                    supported the need for a Uniform Civil Code in India. Near the end of his term, Kalam considered a
                    second term if there was certainty about his victory. However, he chose not to run again to avoid
                    politicizing the presidency, despite backing from various leaders.
                </p>
                <p>In 2012, with the term of the 12th President Pratibha Patil ending, there were speculations about
                    Kalam being nominated for a second term. The BJP indicated potential support if other parties like
                    the Trinamool Congress and Samajwadi Party proposed him. However, despite initial support from
                    Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee, Yadav withdrew his support, leaving Banerjee as the sole
                    supporter. Consequently, on 18 June 2012, Kalam declined to contest, expressing gratitude for the
                    public's affection and support but respecting their wishes by not participating in the election.

            <h3>
                <p>After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of Management
                    Shillong, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management
                    Indore; an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore; chancellor of the Indian
                    Institute of Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram; professor of Aerospace Engineering at
                    Anna University; and an adjunct at many other academic and research institutions across India. He
                    taught information technology at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad,
                    and technology at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University.
                </p>
                <p>In 2011, Kalam was criticised by civil groups over his stand on the Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant;
                    he supported the establishment of the nuclear power plant and was accused of not speaking with the
                    local people. The protesters were hostile to his visit as they saw him as a pro-nuclear scientist
                    and were unimpressed by the assurances he provided regarding the safety features of the plant.
                </p>
                <p>In May 2012, Kalam launched a programme for the youth of India called the What Can I Give Movement,
                    with a central theme of defeating corruption.

                <ul>
                    <li>Kalam played a crucial role in the development of India's ballistic missile and space programs.
                        He was the key figure in the successful development of the Agni and Prithvi missiles, which
                        bolstered India's defence capabilities.</li>
                    <li>As the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the head of the Indian Defense
                        Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Kalam played a pivotal role in India's successful
                        nuclear tests in Pokhran in 1998, establishing India as a nuclear power.</li>
                    <li>Kalam was closely associated with India's space research organization, ISRO (Indian Space
                        Research Organisation). He advocated and supported the development of various satellite launch
                        vehicles, including the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the Geosynchronous Satellite
                        Launch Vehicle (GSLV).</li>
                    <li>Kalam was a visionary leader who articulated the concept of "Vision 2020," a blueprint for
                        transforming India into a developed nation by the year 2020. He emphasized the importance of
                        technology, education, and sustainable development in achieving this goal.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Kalam was an inspiration to millions, especially the youth of India. He actively engaged with
                    students and encouraged them to pursue careers in science and technology. His speeches and
                    interactions with students will motivate generations to aim high and work towards a better India.
                    The government of India celebrates APJ Abdul Kalam’s birthday as World Student Day on October 15
                    annually. Also, an island near the coast of Orrisa was renamed APJ Abdul Kalam Island after his
                    death on 4 September 2015.
